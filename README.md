# HealthPulse Kiosk

The HealthPulse Kiosk is a comprehensive health monitoring system designed to provide accurate, rapid, and hassle-free diagnostic reports for users in rural and remote areas. It integrates advanced sensors, machine learning models, and a user-friendly interface to ensure convenient and reliable health monitoring.

## Features

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Utilizes sensors such as ECG, GSR, pulse oximeter, and temperature sensors to collect vital health data.
   - Sensors are integrated via an ESP32 module.

2. **Data Transmission**:
   - Collected data is transmitted to a Google Sheets database through the ESP32 module for centralized storage and analysis.

3. **Machine Learning Integration**:
   - The EasyTiny module on the ESP32 is used to deploy and run machine learning models.
   - Trained models analyze sensor data to provide real-time health predictions.

4. **Real-Time Monitoring and Visualization**:
   - Health metrics and predictions are displayed on a web interface.
   - The interface includes real-time graphs and readings for ECG, pulse, oxygen levels, temperature, and stress/anxiety levels.
